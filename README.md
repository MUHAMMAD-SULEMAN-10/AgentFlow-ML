AgentFlow-ML
Multi-Agent AI System combining TensorFlow & PyTorch for intelligent data analysis and decision making.


Overview
AgentFlow-ML orchestrates four specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex machine learning tasks using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
The Agents:

Data Analyst (TensorFlow) - Data preprocessing and statistical analysis

Pattern Recognizer (PyTorch) - Neural network-based pattern detection

Decision Maker (TensorFlow) - Strategic decision making with confidence scoring

Report Generator (Python) - Comprehensive performance reporting
